# Overview
This program creates a simple map using ArcGIS, focused around Rexburg, Idaho. This program helped me learn the basics of a mapping library like ArcGis. 

My program is quite simple; after running the index.html file with live server, a map is loaded. On the map, a small arrow can be found. This arrow indicates
wind direction, and the user can find out more weather data by clicking on the arrow. I used to ArcGIS Living Atlas 'Current Weather and Wind Station Data'
for this project. You can search around the globe if you like and see weather data for all kinds of different places.
Some stations may be missing data.

The goal of this program is to further my learning in relation to mapping libraries and APIs which can combine data and mapping together.

# Development Environment
The tools I used to develop this software were Visual Studio Code and ArcGIS.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used JavaScript and a little bit of HTML for my program and the ArcGIS mapping library, as well as their Living Atlas.
